# Quilter

Quilter is a Tauri app to help create Quilts for Looking Glass products. This app is designed to be used with the Blender plugin - more specifically with [our fork](https://github.com/transcental/AmberLG) of it. We have a currently [open PR](https://github.com/regcs/AliceLG/pull/139) to merge our changes into the original plugin.
